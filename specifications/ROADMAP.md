# mentorHub Specifications

The mentorHub platform serves the needs of staff, members, mentors, partners, and donors. The system's primary purpose is to give apprentices real-world experience working in a modern computing environment, and the full design-build-run SDLC for a cloud-native platform.

## Personas

For the purpose of documenting Hills statements, we will use the following persona's. These persona's can also act in some cases as a proxy for a RBAC Role.

### Developer Personas

These personas represent software engineers who are designing, building, and running the mentorHub platform.

- Sam the Software Engineer is responsible for the code in one or more repositories, and for approving pull requests in those repositories.

- Tonya the Tester leads end-to-end testing of the code, and manages releases of components into the Testing Environment, and approves the promotion of code into the Staging environment.

- Rhonda the Release Manager is responsible for coordinating the release of new versions of code with the SQA team. They work with Tonya to promote release candidates from the Testing environment into the Staging environment.

- Pam the Product Manager is responsible for coordinating the release of new versions of code between Rhonda and the Marketing team.

### End User Personas

These persona's represent hands-on-keyboard Users of the mentorHub platform.

- Maven the Mentor provides mentorship services to members, and colaborates with other Mentors to imrpove the quality of learning resources.

- Appollo the Apprentice learns new technology by working through an agile cirriculum crafted with their mentor.

- Fran the Financioal Officer does the books, and the taxes, and issues receipts for tax deductable donations.

- Meredith the Marketer conducts marketing campaigns to find new members, mentors, partners, and donors.

## Roadmap of Meaningful Outcomes

### Now (SRE First)

### Next

### Later

Who: Humanity
What: Education Revolution
And then WOW: People are empowered to create value, major progress towards the biggest problems occurs (climate, war, unsafe AI)
Who: Tech Industry
What: Swiss Army Knife Professionals
And then WOW: AI is implemented and integrated in ways never seen before
Who: Mentor
What: Mentorship
And then WOW: Mentee gains confidence and experience
Who: The commons, the public
What: Open and accessible education and career training that has lots of value
And then WOW: Closes talent gap

PR Reviewer approves a pull request, and merges the branch into main and then multi-architectre containers are built and deployed into a cloud hosted Dev environment where initial end-to-end testing occurs.
Testing Lead uses a /test discord bot to specify a domain to be promoted to the test environment and then the selected services are promoted from the Dev environment into the Test environment.
Release Manager uses a /stage discord bot and then all of the services in the Test environment are poromoted to the staging environment.
Product Manager uses a /go-live! discord bot and then all of the services in the Staging environment are poromoted to the production environment.

a scrum master holds regular
an apprentice reads a readme and can set up and tool their environment and onboard to the project async
Software Engineers execute a single bash command and then a local database, with meaningful test data, is available for testing.
Software QA Engineers issue a single bash command and then the solution is available for local testing.
UI/UX Engineers issue a single bash command and then a local API and Backing database are available for testing.
SRE's review a Promethius/Grafana monitoring portal and then they can view performance and throughput metrics for the system.
SRE's deploy a database management container and then schema constraints and migrations are executed when database configuration updates are required.
Data, API, and UI Engineers build and test their code locally before submitting a pull request and then push-storms are reduced and CI expenses are managed.
API software engineers query a Version document from a Collection and then they can make that information observable.
API and UI Engineers run a suite of black-box tests and then they have confirmation of functionality to support publication of code when unit testing is impeeding release.
SRE's open an Admin UI page, or API Endpoint, and then they know what code is running, and how the services are configured to more effectively diagnose incident root cause.
API and UI Engineers save changes as they work and then unit tests run increasing awareness of potential defects introduced by code changes improving developer productivity.

an apprentice clicks a button and is presented a tooling report w/ links to any failing or needed hardware or software issues to address
